# Project Overview :

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in Term 2 of Machine Learning Nanodegree Program. In this project, I have build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
